# Acknowledgments & Dependencies
This software package is built upon the shoulders of the [libgcrypt library](https://www.gnupg.org/software/libgcrypt/index.html), all honour and glory to those developers.
In order to compile, you will need to install libgcrypt first e.g. on a Debian based system this should be as simple as:

    sudo apt install libgcrypt20-dev
